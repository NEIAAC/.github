# NEIAAC

We are a student association at the [University of Coimbra](https://github.com/UniversityOfCoimbra) representing the students of the Department of Engineering & Informatics. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, be that with activities, events, or projects.

Here you can find some of the tools we've built, configuration files for our workflows, datasets we maintain, and the code behind our public platforms.
